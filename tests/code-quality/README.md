# Code Quality Tests

This directory contains tests for assessing the quality of code in the SmartWrite project, focusing on aspects like commenting, formatting, and coding standards.

## Overview

These tests help ensure consistent code quality across the project by automatically analyzing various aspects of the code:

- Comment coverage and quality
- Adherence to formatting standards
- Potential code smells or issues

## Available Tests

### Comment Quality Test

The `commentQuality.test.js` file analyzes the code comments throughout the project:

- Measures comment-to-code ratio
- Evaluates comment descriptiveness
- Checks for files with insufficient comments
- Provides a detailed report on comment quality

## Running the Tests

To run all code quality tests:

```bash
node tests/code-quality/runCodeQualityTests.js
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
node tests/code-quality/commentQuality.test.js
```

## Understanding the Results

The tests provide detailed reports with:

- Files analyzed
- Quality metrics for each file
- Overall project statistics
- Pass/fail assessment based on minimum quality thresholds

### Comment Quality Thresholds

The comment quality test uses these thresholds:

- At least 5% of the codebase should be comments
- At least 80% of files should have adequate comments
- Comments should be descriptive (at least 3 words on average)

## Adding New Tests

To add new code quality tests:

1. Create a new test file in this directory
2. Add the test file name to the `testFiles` array in `runCodeQualityTests.js`
3. Ensure the test follows the pattern of exiting with code 0 for success or non-zero for failure

## Why Code Quality Matters

Maintaining high code quality through good commenting practices:

- Makes code more maintainable
- Improves collaboration between developers
- Reduces onboarding time for new team members
- Decreases debugging time and effort
